		<h2>Southampton closing in on Mislav Orsic signing</h2>
		<p>Southampton are close to signing Dinamo Zagreb's Mislav Orsic.</p>
		<p>It is understood that a deal has been agreed that will see the 30-year-old move to St Mary's in the January transfer window. Southampton are keen to bring in their targets quickly and Nathan Jones wanted to add experience to his side.</p>
		<p>The south coast side are believed to have offered around 6 million pounds plus add-ons for Orsic and the improved offer has seen Zagreb accept the bid.</p>
		<p>Everton and Nottingham Forest have also been linked with a move for Orsic, but it appears the Croatia international looks set to join Nathan Jones' team.</p>
		<p>Orsic represented Croatia at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and scored a goal during his nation's third-place play-off victory over Morocco.</p>
