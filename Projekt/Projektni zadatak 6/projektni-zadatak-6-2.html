		<h2>Cristiano Ronaldo mania in Saudi Arabia</h2>
		<p>Al Nassr have never won the Asian Champions League, they are not even the most successful club of the province of Riyadh, but with the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo they have won over everyone in Saudi Arabia and abroad.</p>
		<p>The arrival of the Portuguese star has transformed the club. While awaiting his debut, the team's store and sports city have been the first to experience the transformation.</p>
		<p>"It's been a crazy few days. People filled the entire store, everything you see and outside was packed, we had to call members of the club's security to come and help us organize it," said the manager who has been serving customers at the Al Nassr store for the past four years.</p>
		<p>"In the first days after his signing, we couldn't keep up, we had to ask for reinforcements because we were running out of jerseys, number 7s, everything."</p>
		<p>We at MARCA were witnesses of that. Every person who enters the store comes to get a Cristiano Ronaldo jersey. Of the first team jersey, apart from those of the mannequins that decorate the store, there are no more.</p>
